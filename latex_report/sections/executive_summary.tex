The Smart Proxy is an advanced web security tool designed to protect users from phishing attacks and malicious websites. It operates as an intermediary between the user and the internet, automatically scanning web traffic for signs of phishing attempts, malicious code, and other security threats.

Unlike conventional security tools that rely solely on blacklists or basic pattern matching, this system employs a multi-layered approach, combining machine learning models with traditional pattern analysis to achieve higher detection accuracy while minimizing false positives. Additionally, it features an innovative bypass mechanism that allows users to access flagged sites when they believe a detection is incorrect, without compromising overall security.

\section*{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning-Based Detection}: Utilizes XGBoost models to identify phishing sites based on URL and content features
    \item \textbf{Traditional Pattern Analysis}: Scans for suspicious JavaScript, hidden iframes, and known phishing keywords
    \item \textbf{Whitelist Management}: Complete CRUD interface for managing trusted domains with pagination
    \item \textbf{Bypass System}: Token-based mechanism allowing users to override false positives
    \item \textbf{Detailed Block Pages}: Informative warning pages with specific detection information
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimizations}: Caching, selective scanning, and other optimizations for minimal browsing impact
\end{itemize}

This smart proxy system represents a significant step forward in web security by balancing robust protection with user flexibility. The integration of machine learning models provides advanced threat detection capabilities, while the bypass system ensures that legitimate sites incorrectly flagged can still be accessed when necessary.
