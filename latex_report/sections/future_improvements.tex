\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Quantization}: Reduce ML model size and inference time
    \item \textbf{Parallel Processing}: Implement multi-threaded scanning for large pages

    \item \textbf{Medium-term (3-6 months)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Browser extension development
        \item Advanced ML model with ensemble methods
        \item Multi-language support
        \item Mobile device configuration support
